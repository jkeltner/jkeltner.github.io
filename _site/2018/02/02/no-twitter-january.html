    <p>For a few years now I’ve done a “no alcohol” January. I started that after a
particularly long New Years Even when I just felt the need to “detox” a bit. I
actually enjoyed doing it and felt quite good afterwards. I also found that
after totally giving up alcohol for a while, I reduced my overall consumption
moving forward. And I lost a few pounds!</p>

<p>This year I added a “no Twitter” policy. I was inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/@davegirouard">Dave
Girouard</a> who went further giving up
Facebook (which I haven’t been on in years), Twitter, alcohol and dessert. I
couldn’t go with him on the last one… I tend to look at Twitter quite
regularly, so I wasn’t sure how this little experiment would go. However,
after a month I really enjoy the peace that comes with not having Twitter.</p>

<p>The first week or so was the hardest part. I would find myself worrying that I
was missing something or was uninformed. Of course, that’s just silly. I get
the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing">New York Times Morning Briefing
newsletter,</a> which gives
me just enough news. And I have my <a href="https://feedly.com">Feedly</a> subscriptions,
which pick up the details in tech and fintech. The idea that you’re missing
something important is really just in your head.</p>

<p>However, having no Twitter on the phone changed my relationship with the
phone. Sometimes I would check email, or read through my Feedly headlines and
realize there was nothing left to do on my phone. Previously, I would open
Twitter and scroll through for a while. It essentially turned my phone into an
endless experience that could just suck up any idle time. Now, I tend to
finish my task with the phone and realize there’s nothing there left to look
at — and it feels amazingly freeing. It feels like I have retaken control over
my relationship with my phone, and that’s a great feeling.</p>

<p>So, I’m back on Twitter now, but I expect to use it much less. I’ve turned on
email notifications for replies and DMs so I don’t miss anything. I expect to
check in every now and then, but I expect it will be much less a part of my
daily life.</p>
