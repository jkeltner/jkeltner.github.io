    <p>It’s not a law that’s taught in school — or really anywhere. Typically this
law we can learn only through experience. However, it may be one of the most
important and under-rated laws anyone can understand to succeed in life.</p>

<p>The reality is that most of the time things don’t work out the way we expect.
Often our decisions have predictable outcomes — but there are usually also
unintended consequences. Sometimes they’re positive — but all too often they
are not.</p>

<p>I am often reminded of this law whenever I start to think about government
policy. So much of government policy ends up having nearly as many unintended
consequences as the intended ones.</p>

<p>Whether it’s wage controls during WWII leading to our system of employer-
provided health care, or the war on drugs tearing apart communities of color
through mass incarceration, or a startup pivoting after seeing how users
really use their product — they are all example of times when the unintended
consequences of an action, decision, or product outweighed the intended ones.</p>

<p>The same sorts of unintended consequences exist in every aspect of our
personal and work lives. It’s impossible to predict these sorts of
consequences perfectly — but it’s still worth thinking about them in advance
and trying to predict. And, perhaps more importantly, it’s critical to watch
for them after the fact — and adjust to the reality that may not match your
expectations.</p>
