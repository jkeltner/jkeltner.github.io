<p>I talk to a lot of people about productivity and effectiveness at work and one
topic seems to be coming up more and more often these days ‚Äî the craziness of
calendars. This is a topic worthy of multiple posts for sure as there are many
issues with calendars these days. One big topic is that many people I know
simply have too many meetings on their calendar ‚Äî and not enough time to get
work done. But in this post, I want to tackle one in particular ‚Äî what I
sometimes call ‚ÄúCalendar Tetris‚Äù.</p>

<p>images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*4J0Hepk0bmPMJkhC)<img src="https://cdn-
images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*CxhCl3L9x75pFOCi" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is where you need to schedule a meeting with a group of people and there
is simply no available time for the meeting. So you begin to look for places
where there are only a few conflicts to see if you could move one or two
meetings to make space. But which meetings can you effectively move without
much delay? The space of possibilities explore in number very quickly but the
logic is quite simple. This is exactly the sort of problem that is better
solved by computers than by people ‚Äî which makes me ask why this have either
Microsoft or Google done this?</p>

<p>The lack of a solution here actually makes it harder for me to really block
time on my calendar, which I think is a great practice. If I need an hour to
do real work, I want to put that hour on my calendar so I know I have an hour
to do that work. But I don‚Äôt really need <strong>that</strong> hour, I need <strong>an</strong> hour. If
I can move that to make time for a meeting, I‚Äôm happy to. But calendars don‚Äôt
work that way ‚Äî so I often don‚Äôt put those blocks on my calendar at all so I
have time for important meetings.</p>

<p>Or worse, sometimes people just book over things on my calendar which they
think are less important than their meeting. Sometimes they‚Äôre right ‚Äî
sometimes they‚Äôre not. Plus, I don‚Äôt always notice when this happens ‚Äî and I
really need to move whatever was booked over.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are executive assistants who can work through these issues for
you ‚Äî but it‚Äôs often just as frustrating and time consuming for them. And
honestly, laborious manual processes that don‚Äôt take a lot of judgement are
perfectly suited to automation. This doesn‚Äôt even take fancy AI/ML techniques!
Here‚Äôs the hoping someone at Google is paying attention and tackles this (I
say Google since we use GSuite, so a MSFT solution doesn‚Äôt help me‚Ä¶ üòâ)</p>
