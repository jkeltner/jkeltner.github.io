    <p>I continue to notice the conversation around machine learning and artificial
intelligence (ML/AI) in the finance sector to be driven in large part by the
concept of chatbots specifically, and conversational interfaces (eg Amazon
Alexa, Google Home) more broadly I find this a bit of a mystery as I think
there easier and more impactful areas in finance to apply machine learning.
Why the skepticism about chatbots? Here are my reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>They are hard to do well.</strong> This is true for a number of reasons. Chatbots generally require natural language processing (a difficult and not well-solved problem) and the ability to handle a wide variety of requests. You can simplify the problem by providing a menu of options, but that starts to look like a text-based IVR — which isn’t inspiring.</li>
  <li><strong>Apps work pretty well.</strong> Given that likely users of chatbots already have a bank’s mobile app we have to consider how much better chatbots will work than the existing apps. For instance, I can get to my account balance with just a fingerprint in most banking apps. The most common uses are reasonably well handled in most banking mobile apps today — and having to type out commands will likely take longer than a well-designed app-based interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is more perplexing to me, is that there are many areas ripe for use of
ML/AI. Many back office functions from credit underwriting, to fraud detection
and process automation are great candidates for the use of ML/AI. And, while
they don’t make great user-facing demos, they are often problems well-suited
to machine learning — they have relatively well defined inputs (eg credit
files, site interaction points, etc) and they have large existing data sets
that can be used for training models.</p>

<p>At Upstart, we are using machine learning to improve credit underwriting,
automation, and fraud prevention to great effect. You can see more about the
results we have achieved <a href="https://www.upstart.com/about">on our website</a>.</p>

<p>I would love to see more conversations about how we can use AI/ML to really
improve core banking functions and user experience. Over the next few weeks,
I’ll be heading to the <a href="https://www.aba.com/Training/Conferences/Pages/annual.aspx">American Banker’s Association Annual
Convention</a> and
<a href="https://www.money2020.com/">Money 20/20</a> and I’ll be looking around to see
what other interesting use cases FIs have found for ML/AI. Let me know if
you’ll be at either show and want to catch up!</p>
