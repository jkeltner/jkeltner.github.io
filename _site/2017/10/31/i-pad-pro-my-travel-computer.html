    <p>I’m writing this piece from NYC, where I’ve traveled from CA for two days with
only my iPad Pro (okay, I brought some clothes too…). I bought a 10.5” iPad
Pro a few months ago and it has really become my go to computer for almost any
time I’m out of the office. I find it to be the ideal device when I’m on the
go — whether I’m out meetings customers, attending a conference, or just
working from a coffee shop; it’s usually all I take.</p>

<p>There are many reasons I love heading out with just an iPad. First of all, it
feels very freeing — small, lightweight, and always connected. With built-in
LTE, I never worry about connecting to the wifi at a customer’s office or a
coffee shop. I am always comfortable that when I open up the iPad, I will be
connected. I bought a very small <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KHJOXOM/ref=oh-aui-detailpage-o04-s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Tomtoc
Case</a>
that can hold my <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods/">Airpods</a>, the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/">Apple
Pencil</a>, and a few business cards. It’s
the perfect thing to carry around for a busy day in meetings or at a
conference.</p>

<p>More importantly, I find that I can get pretty much everything done on the
iPad that I can on my laptop. To be sure, there are things that are still much
easier on a laptop — working with large spreadsheets, building presentations,
writing code, managing Salesforce.com administrative tasks, etc. But for the
most part, these are things I do infrequently and not usually when I’m out of
the office for a day or two. And the iPad allows me to easily review a
spreadsheet and make quick edits (to my sales pipeline for example) or edit a
presentation with a few last minute tweaks.</p>

<p>But the form factor of the iPad really shines in unlocking new use cases. My
two current favorite involve sharing content with the iPad. I use Keynote for
my presentations (if you haven’t tried it, you really should!). In smaller
meetings and at conferences, I have started just bringing the iPad out and
placing it on the table to go over a few charts or graphs with people. It’s
incredibly effective — and much simpler than pulling out a laptop and finding
somewhere to put it.</p>

<p>More surprisingly, I’ve found the iPad to be my absolute favorite presentation
device! This is because, unlike on most laptops, it is easy to have open both
a presentation and a way to take notes on the conversation! Using the split
screen feature in iOS, I can have <a href="https://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a>
open as any portion of the screen (80%, 50% or 20%) and it will drive an
external display, while I can use the remaining screen space for taking notes
(I currently <strong>LOVE</strong> using <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/">Bear</a> for taking
notes — check it out!). This is something that is hard to do on a laptop — and
seamless on my iPad. Even more impressive, Keynote on the iPad gives me to
have a digital laser pointer and the ability to directly write or draw on
slides — so I can respond to questions directly in the presentation very
easily. Try doing that on your laptop!</p>

<p>I’ll be honest, I started traveling with just my iPad in large part just to
see if I could. We all know (or at least we hear and we think we must believe)
that the world is going to mobile devices. I wanted to test the capability to
actually live in that mobile first world. And while I’m not ready to give up
my MacBook Pro just yet — I’m finding myself leaving the office more often
with just the iPad Pro and it definitely feels like the future.</p>
