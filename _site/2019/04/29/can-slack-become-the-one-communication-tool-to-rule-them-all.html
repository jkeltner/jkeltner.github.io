    <p>I was an early and vocal fan of Slack. I helped bring it into
<a href="https://www.upstart.com">Upstart</a> and have even set it up for a number of
one-off use cases. I had high hopes that a new tool would give us a chance to
fix some of the issues that have plagued email. We are now a few years in, and
the results are decidedly mixed. I don’t blame Slack here, but I think we are
all struggling to figure out how to manage our technology tools to be more
productive — and avoid having them become non-stop distractions.</p>

<p>Slack has really taken over the bulk of my internal communications. It has
become an invaluable tool for me. Let’s start with the things that make Slack
a great tool.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integrations from outside systems to provide alerts/notices. We have a number of systems that post real time. These are incredibly useful and turn Slack into a sort of command center for my daily life.</li>
  <li>Defaulting to channel/team communication so that information is shared broadly. This is really useful in keeping a whole team up-to-date. Too many times with email we leave people off “to spare their inbox” and not because they shouldn’t know something. I think sharing more information more broadly is generally very useful for an organization.</li>
  <li>Real-time communications. This is sort of Slack’s bread and butter and it works incredibly well.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there are still a number of ways in which Slack bothers me — and can
become a distraction that pulls me away from my more meaningful work. I think
there are two overall concepts that almost all communication technologies
handle poorly — and most of us end up using multiple communications tools to
separate communications along these axes.</p>

<p><strong>‌Synchronous vs Asynchronous</strong><br />
The first concept I think is overlooked is the difference between synchronous
and asynchronous communications needs. Sometimes when I am contacting someone,
I really need an immediate answer and sometimes I don’t. However, Slack (and
most communication tools) don’t let me differentiate between these two kinds
of messages.</p>

<p>In general, Slack tends to default to synchronous communication — but that’s
not always what we want. Many questions are looking for more thoughtful,
considered answers. The default to synchronous communication pushes people to
quicker, simpler answers. This means I send many issues in need of more though
via email instead of Slack.</p>

<p><strong>Interrupt Levels</strong><br />
The second, related issue is around what I (in a throw-back to my engineering
days) call interrupt levels — that is how much do I want to interrupt what
someone else is doing for them to see this message. For some messages this is
quite high, for others it is very low.</p>

<p>This is somewhat solved within channels by disabling notifications and then
allowing users to leverage @here and @channel to send notifications for more
urgent issues. However, it is much harder in one-to-one messages where there
is no way to really designate whether a message is urgent or not. In general I
treat Slack as a non-urgent channel and then have people use phone/text for
urgent issues.</p>

<p>Perhaps the vision of having a unified communications tool that can handle the
full breadth of communication needs just isn’t practical and we will forever
be stuck using different tools for different needs. However, I continue to
dream of the day I will have one tool for all of my company communication
needs — something that is flexible enough to fill all of my needs. Maybe one
day Slack will be there — but not yet.</p>
