title: A Quick Tip
---

I love quick and simple tricks that help solve real problems. I also love
keyboard shortcuts and I’ve recently run across a slick one I wanted to share.
I often have small snippets of text that I need to add into emails or calendar
invites. For example — my UberConference number or my Calendly scheduling
link. And I have found a new, very easy way to access them — through
[1Password](https://1password.com/) Mini!

[1Password](https://1password.com/) is a fabulous password manager. I also use
it to securely store critical information, like SSNs, Passport numbers, bank
account numbers, etc and share them with my wife. However, I recently added a
few of these key pieces of information in there — and it has been incredibly
useful!


So, let’s say I’m writing an email and I want to include my
[Calendly](http://calendly.com) scheduling link — I just hit Cmd-Opt-\ to
bring up 1Password Mini. Is start typing ‘Calendly’ — and once the option is
highlighted I can hit the right arrow to move to the details and then just hit
‘Enter’ to copy the URL. Then a quick Cmd-V in my email application — and boom
the link is in my email — in 3 second flat!

So, I’ve now added my [Calendly](http://calendly.com) links,
[Uberconference](https://www.uberconference.com) number and other similar
items to OnePassword. It may not be rocket science — but this trick is saving
me time so I thought I’d share it.
