title: Slick Integration - Slack + Google Drive
---

I’m constantly impressed with Slack’s execution, particularly around
integrations. They are very good at executing the little things that really
make for a delightful customer experience. One grat example of that is their
integration with Google Drive.

First, if you send a link to any Google Drive file in a Slack Channel, it will
check to see if everyone has access to the file. If not, it will give you an
inline option to provide Read, Comment or Edit access to everyone in the
channel — without leaving Slack! It’s a simple thing — but so convenient (and
saves so much back and forth to fix permissions!)


Even more impressive, when someone comments in a Doc, Slack will send the
comment via a Slack message from the Google Drive bot. You can then follow
comments without having to re-open the Doc — and you can respond to comments
or questions right inline. It’s a very seamless way to integrate the two
experiences.


Sometimes it’s the smallest features that make user’s lives much better. These
integrations are a great example of that. Simple, but amazingly powerful.
Kudos to Slack and Google!
