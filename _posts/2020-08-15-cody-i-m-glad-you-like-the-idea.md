Cody, I'm glad you like the idea. It really comes from David Allen's Getting
Things Done methodology, so I can't take any credit. I have NEVER had an empty
list here - not even close. Generally it's the opposite, where it's quite
large and I then remove items that I realize I will never actually get to.
