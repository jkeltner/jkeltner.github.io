I really believe that the best way to get kids to engage with engineering
topics is to have fun, engaging projects for them to tackle. All theory and no
play makes for a dull experience and glossed over eyes. It’s part of my belief
that we should have more [top-down learning](https://jeffkeltner.com/top-down-
learning/), and less bottoms-up learning — especially in complex areas like
hardware and software engineering.

I’ve had some luck getting my kids excited about coding by using a
programmable drone (you can read more [here](https://jeffkeltner.com/flying-
drones-with-code/) and [here](https://jeffkeltner.com/flying-drones-with-
google-assistant/)). For the first month we had the drone, my son taught every
friend who came to our house how to write a basic Python program and code the
drone. He loved it — and his friends did as well. Seeing your code cause a
physical object to obey your wishes has a certain magic to it.

That’s why I was excited to see the launch of Kickstarter of the [Sphero
RVR](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sphero/sphero-rvr-the-go-anywhere-
do-anything-programmabl). It looks like a great rover for getting kids excited
about code. I love that it is both programmable and will be hardware
expandable. Engaging kids with both hardware and software is an exciting
opportunity — and opens up a lot of possibilities for different projects and
areas to explore.

I’m looking forward to playing with one of these with my kids. If you want to
get your kids excited about engineering (or just have a fun set of challenges
for yourself on the weekends), give it a try!
