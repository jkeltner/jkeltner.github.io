title: Apollo 11
---

I have greatly enjoyed watching the various celebrations for the 50th
anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. I watched the recent [Apollo 11
documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvvhAft0-Tw) with my family as
well as seeing the [traveling Apollo 11 show](https://apollo11show.com/) that
was in Pasadena. My kids have found it somewhat interesting, but I have been
mesmerized by the history of that accomplishment.


It’s amazing to think what we as a society were able to achieve in a
relatively short period of time when we were so focused and properly
motivated. It is one of the most awe-inspiring stories in our history — in
every sense of the word. It’s also one of the most hopeful — as the entire
world for a one short period of time was joined together in celebration of
what we as a species were able to achieve. They say over 500M people watched
the moon landing live on TV — a truly astounding statistic.

Imagine what we as a society and a species could accomplish if we spent more
time working together to do the truly amazing — instead of spending so much
time, energy and money fighting with one another. We often use the phrase
moonshot to describe big, audacious ideas or projects. Perhaps we should aim
for more moonshots that can unite us all behind a common purpose.
