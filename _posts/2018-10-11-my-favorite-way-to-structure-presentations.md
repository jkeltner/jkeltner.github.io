title: My Favorite Way to Structure Presentations
---

In my line of work, I end up building a lot of presentations. While different
venues and formats often call for different styles, there is one general
format/structure that I find almost always works well for any type of
presentation.

Give each slide a headline that is a full sentence. Reading the slide titles
in order should tell a good story — the pieces should connect together well.
On each slide, place evidence to support the claim made in the headline.

This format has a few great features.

It’s easy for anyone who receives the presentation and is watching it be
delivered to follow.

It forces you to make sure that you are telling an overall story — and not
just a bunch of disjointed tidbits.

And it still works very well for in-person presentations.

If you’re working on a presentation — I highly encourage you to give it a try.
