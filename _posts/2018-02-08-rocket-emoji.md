title: Rocket Emoji
---

I love finding small apps that make my life better. This has led me to try I
can’t count how many task management apps (my current one is
[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/), if you’re interested). Many times
I eat up cycles for little or no reason.

However, one recent fabulous find has been
[Rocket](http://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/). It’s s simple Mac app that lets
you insert Emoji into any application. That may sound silly, but it’s been
really useful for me. Sure, Apple has an emoji keyboard for the Mac, but it’s
hard to pull up and slow.

Rocket autocompletes emoji whenever you start typing with a :. It can exclude
certain applications like Slack (which has its own custom emoji) or code
editors as well as website where the colon may be used regularly. It’s a
small, but very helpful app — and I highly recommend it!
