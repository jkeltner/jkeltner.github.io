### Pick Fewer Battles

> “Choose your battles wisely.”

I can’t begin to count how many times I’ve been given this advice — or how
many times I’ve failed to live up to it. I have found the process of learning
to be a better husband to be consistent more or less of internalizing this
lesson. Each year I manage to let more things go, to pick fewer battles — and
I pretty much always end up happier because of it. That I’m still learning
this after more than 10 years of marriage just goes to show that I’m a slow
learner.

The worst of these battles are always the pointless ones. The ones where two
hours later you forget what you were arguing about. I’m especially prone to
these as I have a compulsive need to be right and I actually enjoy arguing.
But recently, I heard a great question that helps me in those moments

“Would you rather be right or happy?”

It’s a simple question that provides a profound perspective. For almost any
argument at home, my answer is usually “happy”. So I choose fewer battles,
argue less, and become happier for it.
