I think of a task as anything I can complete in one sitting. If it takes
longer than that - it's really a project. I typically think of projects as
relatively defined sets of tasks. Say, creating a blog post for my company. It
might take a draft, copy editing, review, and legal approval. Pretty well
defined. An objective is usually more outcome oriented and less well defined.
For instance, lose X pounds. Even though it's clearly defined - the required
actions to achieve the objective are not entirely clear.
