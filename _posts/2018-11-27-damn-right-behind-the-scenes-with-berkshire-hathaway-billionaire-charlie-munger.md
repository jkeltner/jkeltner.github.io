title: Damn Right! Behind the Scenes with Berkshire Hathaway Billionaire Charlie
---

I just finished[ this
biography](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1160.Damn-Right-) of Charlie
Munger. It’s bit outdated (originally published in 2000), but still a very
interesting read. I increasingly find myself drawn to biographies and
histories in my reading.

This book contains an interesting personal story with a lot of interesting
background on the relationship between Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet. I
found Munger to be a fascinating character full of tons of wisdom. A few of my
favorite quotes:

“People underrate the importance of a few simple big ideas.”

“Success means being very patient but aggressive when it’s time.”

“In my whole life, nobody has ever accused me of being humble. Although
humility is a trait I much admire, I don’t think I quite got my full share.”
