title: My Favorite (Current) Productivity Hack
---

These headphones are my favorite productivity hack at the moment. For some
reason, when I put them on (with the right type of music) I am substantially
more productive. This is true even when I’m working from and no one is going
to interrupt me whether I have them on or not. There’s just something about
blocking out the world in general that helps me really focus and just power
through a long list of action items. I find this has been particularly helpful
during the pandemic work-from-home environment as there is just more noise to
block out.

I have also recently greatly enjoyed the background music (if that’s the right
word) available through [brain.fm](https://brain.fm). While I love music,
sometimes songs can be distracting and brain.fm is all instrumental (or
soundscape) type background music that is specially created to help you focus
while working and I find they work very well for that purpose (I’m listening
to the “VHS Dream” soundtrack right now).

Related tip: if I manage to power through a lot of action items early in the
day, it builds up momentum that will carry me through the rest of my day with
enhanced productivity (even if I take of the headphones later). Setting the
right tone for yourself early each day pays huge dividends…
