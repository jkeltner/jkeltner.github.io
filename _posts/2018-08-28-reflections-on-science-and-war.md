Enola Gay B29 that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan.

I recently returned from a trip to DC with my family. On our way out of town,
we chose to visit the Steven F. Udvar Hazy museum, part of the Smithsonian’s
Air and Space Museum. As a sucker for anything about flight and space — and as
the father of two young boys — this museum was an absolute hit.

The space is cavernous and home to a huge variety of flying objects. It houses
everything from a Space Shuttle (Discovery), to a Concorde, to the B29 that
dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima (the Enola Gay), to an XF–35 thrown, to a
wide array of missiles and other weapons.

I found myself noting the difference between the Space Shuttle, weather
satellites, and competition planes and the other military hardware. Some of
these machines were built for the purpose of discovery — of pushing the
boundaries of human knowledge and experience. Others were built to destroy
what we have built and kill our fellow man.

However, the reality is that the dichotomy between the two is not nearly so
clear as that description would lead you to believe. The reality is that many
of our scientific discoveries have come through military investments. Our
scientific advancement has been inextricably linked with our investment in
military equipment — and often with war.

That was a sobering realization that came to me when looking at Gemini
capsules next to cruise missiles in the museum. They may seem to be from very
different parts of our human experience — but they are more closely related
than you might think.
