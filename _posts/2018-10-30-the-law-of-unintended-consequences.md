title: The Law of Unintended Consequences
---

It’s not a law that’s taught in school — or really anywhere. Typically this
law we can learn only through experience. However, it may be one of the most
important and under-rated laws anyone can understand to succeed in life.

The reality is that most of the time things don’t work out the way we expect.
Often our decisions have predictable outcomes — but there are usually also
unintended consequences. Sometimes they’re positive — but all too often they
are not.

I am often reminded of this law whenever I start to think about government
policy. So much of government policy ends up having nearly as many unintended
consequences as the intended ones.

Whether it’s wage controls during WWII leading to our system of employer-
provided health care, or the war on drugs tearing apart communities of color
through mass incarceration, or a startup pivoting after seeing how users
really use their product — they are all example of times when the unintended
consequences of an action, decision, or product outweighed the intended ones.

The same sorts of unintended consequences exist in every aspect of our
personal and work lives. It’s impossible to predict these sorts of
consequences perfectly — but it’s still worth thinking about them in advance
and trying to predict. And, perhaps more importantly, it’s critical to watch
for them after the fact — and adjust to the reality that may not match your
expectations.
