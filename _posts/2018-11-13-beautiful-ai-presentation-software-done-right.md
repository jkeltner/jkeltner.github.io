title: Beautiful[AI] — Presentation software done right
---

This weekend my wife introduced me to
[Beautiful[AI]](https://www.beautiful.ai/), a new presentation tool she had
used to build a recent talk she was giving. She mentioned how much she enjoyed
it, so I had to take a look. It turns out, she’s right! (I already knew she’s
much smarter than I am, so this didn’t surprise me). It is a wonderfully
designed piece of software.

Instead of treating each slide like a canvas and allowing you to build any
sort of graphic you want, it presents you with a variety of pre-designed slide
templates — that are all beautifully designed. It removes some freedom — but
also ensures you get a polished, beautiful final product. For instance, you
can’t change the font of an individual text box — but you can change it for
the whole presentation.

I was really impressed at the breadth of slide templates available — and the
options available to configure them. These options are far more than enough
for most users, even power users. And by removing the focus and stress of
making your slides look good — you can focus on your content and message.

I was really impressed with the app — and I’m looking forward to using it for
some of my upcoming presentations! And if any of my friends from Google are
reading this — take a look at these guys. This is how a modern presentation
tool should work!
