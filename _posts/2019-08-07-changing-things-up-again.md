title: Changing Things Up (Again)
---

I [wrote a while ago](https://jeffkeltner.com/changing-things-up/) about how I
like to change the design of my desk on occasion, really just for the sake of
changing things. The spice of changing things up just seems to help re-
invigorate me from time to time.

Well, I did so again recently. I moved back to using a monitor. I find the
extra space especially helpful when I’m doing a lot of video conferences with
working sessions where I need to actually review a document and watch a video
at the same time.

One big difference this time is that I’m using a USB-c monitor with a monitor
arm. That may sound like a small change, but having a single cable to drive
power, display, and peripherals made my desk much cleaner and the process of
plugging/un-plugging much simpler. I also love the extra desk space from the
monitor arm. One of the pitfalls of a display for me was always the mess of
cables and a huge amount of desk space it ate up — and that is pretty much
resolved now.

I’ve also lost my bamboo. Sadly the container had a leak I couldn’t fix and I
couldn’t keep it alive. My youngest son has replaced it with the coral reef
art you can see above. I do want to add another plant to the desk to bring
some life back to the office.

Overall, I’m really enjoying this setup right now. I also accept that I will
likely change my mind again in a few months and try something new. After all,
it’s always good to change things up a little.
