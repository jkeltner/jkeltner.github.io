title: Sharing Slides Between Decks
---

As someone in an external-facing role, I spend a decent amount of time in
Keynote / PowerPoint / Google Slides building presentations. I give lots of
presentations to external audiences and I often build custom presentations for
each audience. Sort of.

The reality, of course, is that I typically copy a bunch of slides from
different presentations and combine them together. Even many of our standard
slide decks (not the custom ones for a particular presentation) share many
individual slides. Company Overview, Mission, Team, Growth. Key Features, etc

Of course, each of the these slides is updated — and we are perpetually trying
to make sure we have the most recent version of individual slides in each
deck. This seems like a solvable problem with a real library of slides of some
sort. I’m really surprised I haven’t seen an elegant solution to this problem
yet. Google Slides works okay for collaboration on a deck — but not for slides
shared between multiple decks.

If anyone has suggestions for good ways to manage this, I’d love to hear them.
Or if there are any enterpreneurs out there looking for product ideas in the
productivity space — here’s one for you!
