title: Taking notes on paper
---

I see this advice a lot of places, but I really enjoy taking notes on paper. I
know people point to research about how writing engages a different part of
the brain and helps increase long-term retention. I feel like every day or two
I read a post about that topic. That certainly seems reasonable to me, but I
honestly haven’t read any of the research. I find taking notes on paper
helpful for a few different reasons:

  * **It helps me focus.** Unlike my laptop or my iPad, my paper notebooks don’t have access to email or Slack — a big help in making sure I focus on the topic at hand.
  * **I have to synthesize.** I type faster than I write, so I’m tempted to type up notes about nearly everything that’s said. Writing by hand forces to me synthesize and abbreviate — which often helps me to understand.
  * **It works everywhere.** In some of my meetings, pulling up a laptop or iPad just isn’t acceptable. Taking notes on paper works for everyone.

Of course, I want the best of both worlds — including easy access to all my
notes from any device. That means I typically type up my handwritten notes
every day or two. I find this process helpful (and it helps remind me to add
action items to my task list), but it is time-consuming and can fall by the
wayside.

I also enjoy brainstorming and working through problems on paper. Keeping a
notebook around is helpful so I can do that. [As I’ve written
before](https://jeffkeltner.com/divergent-vs-convergent/), I often find that
my creativity flows better with analog tools — paper chief among them.

So, despite my proclivity for buying the latest gadgets, paper is still a key
part of my workflow. I don’t see that changing anytime soon.
