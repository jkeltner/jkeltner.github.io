title: Make the Audience Your Hero
---

I was recently watching a few presentations which reminded me of one of the
key aspects of a good presentation: make the audience the hero of your story!

We all forget this from time to time. We start with ourselves, our company,
our product, what makes us special, etc, etc. It’s only natural. After all,
that’s the topic we know best — and what we really want to tell the audience
about.

However, the most effective presentations (even those that are really about
selling your company or product) are really about the audience. The magic
isn’t what your product is or can do — it’s all about how their lives or
businesses are improved by your product. The audience has a challenge,
problem, or opportunity — something that your presentation can help them to
solve.

As tempting as it is to make the story of your presentation about your and
your product or service, ultimately the most powerful presentations make your
audience the hero of the story — and you’re just a supporting character
